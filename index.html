                            <p>I am tasked with developing an emotion classification system using the CREMA-D Audio Dataset. The objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify audio recordings into six distinct emotional categories: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Neutral, and Sadness.</p>
                            <p>The CREMA-D dataset stands for "Crowd Sourced Emotional Multimodal Actors Dataset". This dataset contains 7,442 original clips from 9 actors, of which 48 are male and 43 are female between the ages of 20-74. The ethnicities included are African-American, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic, and Unspecified. The actors spoke up to 12 sentences using one of 6 emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, sadness) with 4 different levels of emotional intensity (low, medium, high, unspecified).</p>
                            <p>While there are several metrics by which to measure a CNN's performance (such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1, etc), this model uses accuracy as a measure of the overall correctness of the model's predictions. Accuracy calculates the ratio of correctly classified audio samples to the total number of samples and is appropriate because the six classes are balanced. Because this multi-class classification CNN has six target outputs, the baseline accuracy per class would be ~17%. There are no universally fixed industry standards for success within CNN models, as this judgement varies by domain, task type, data complexity, and real-world performance limitations. For this project, the models will be considered successful if its accuracy on both the testing and validation sets exceed 90%.</p>

                            <p>Python, with its vast ecosystem of libraries and tools, has become a preferred language for financial analysis and prediction. Among its many applications, scraping financial data using Yahoo's API has gained popularity due to several advantages. This research explores the benefits of Python's Yahoo API scraping, focusing on its utility in predicting Tesla's closing prices, incorporating sentiment analysis, and explores time series modeling, its assumptions, various methods, and its advantages and limitations.<\p>
                            <p>Predicting stock prices, like Tesla's (NYSE: TSLA), is a complex task that combines financial indicators, market sentiment, and historical data. This research encompasses several time series modeling techniques of varying complexity to analyze and forecast sequential data. Time series modeling is essential in the domain of financial analysis, such as predicting stock prices. This project delves into several types of time series modeling, each with its unique approach and use cases: Naive Forecast, Historic Mean, Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holt-Winters', SARIMA, and SARIMAX.<\p>

                            <p>Recommendation systems, often referred to as recommender systems or recommendation engines, are a cornerstone of modern digital experiences. They are the algorithms behind personalized suggestions that we encounter in our daily online interactions, whether it's movie recommendations on Netflix, product suggestions on Amazon, or playlist recommendations on Spotify. These systems are designed to analyze and understand user preferences and behavior, enabling platforms to provide tailored content, products, or services.<\p>
                            <p>I am leading a team of consultants who are tasked with pitching recommendation systems to executives at Wine.com. There is great potential in leveraging the website's vast user and product data to drive revenue and enhance user experiences. The challenge is harnessing this wealth of information effectively. My proposal is to implement three key recommender systems tailored to Wine.com's business: Polularity Model, Content-Based Filtering, and Collaborative Filtering<\p>
                            <p> Ultimately, our recommendation engines will significantly enhance the user experience, drive sales, and increase user retention. They provide the means to deliver tailored advertisements, which, in turn, will maximize ad revenue. With these systems in place, Wine.com will not only satisfy existing customers but also attract new ones, fostering long-term growth and profitability.</p>
